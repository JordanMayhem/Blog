How to audit a website for SEO<br>
First audit the XML Sitemap. The sitemap is a directory of URLs to make crawling the website easier for the search engines. Make sure that all of the pages are included in the sitemap. Orphan URLs should be given inlinks and any bad pages should be removed from the sitemap, to eventually fall off of Google’s index. Also add an HTML Sitemap for user readability.
Next, audit the crawl depth. Crawl depth is the amount of clicks it takes from the homepage to get to a resource. Crawl depth should be as low as possible by adding header and footers with good links, sidebar navigations, and menus. 
Third, Use friendly URLs. Friendly URLs are URLs that are human readable, short, and tell the user what the page is about. In addition, there should be breadcrumbs to make the user have an easier time knowing where they are. Bread crumbs tells the user which directory they’re on in the site.
Fourth, make sure that any Internal “Nofollow” Links are proper. Nofollow links wil not be crawled, so make sure that the page is either unpublished or blocked due to confidential data.
Fifth, Include robots.txt rules to stop crawlers from crawling the wrong pages. Also, use noindex meta element for extra protection against being crawled.
All broken internal links should be changed to link to a page properly and any link, external or internal, that is on your website should be fixed to point towards the “final address” in the redirect chain, or a proper page. Redirects can lower your Domain Authority.
Canonical pages are pages with anchor links (links to the same page) linked to themselves. This tells a crawler what the main page is, for example, the main page of a blog that is paginated would be the first page. The first page should be the canonical for the blog pages. Paginated pages means that you can click from one to the next, typically in a daisy chain style. There are multiple ways for pages to be paginated, but best practice is to use “rel” and “prev” tags.
Make sure that there is an SSL certificate, and that it passes validation. It might not pass validation if you are linking to pages that use HTTP. These links should be updated to let SSL pass validation.
Another important topic is “insecure content.” That is content that is flagged by Google as something that not everybody would like to see. An example would be drugs or alcohol on a rehab site. This content can be relevant, but choose wisely or you may be marked as insecure.
Everyone talks about title tags, meta descriptions, and H1s when they discuss SEO. To optimize these properly, stay tuned for my keyword research blog post. For now I’ll mention that you want to avoid duplicates and keyword cannibalization. 
Next is internal linking optimization. This can be done by making sure that all website anchor text is descriptive (avoid using words such as “learn more” or “click here.”
Check that there are no redirect chains. This is when a link redirects more than once. All links should have no redirects. 
Content is king of the web. Having a blog with keyword dense and relevant topics will boost your site. It is important to make it natural sounding and match the tone of the rest of the site. 
Set up Google Analytics and Google search console. Make sure you set therse up with the proper filters, and submit the sitemap to search console. 
Check for old tech issues such as having “hidden content” also known as “keyword stuffing.” Remove flash elements, content within Iframes, and duplicate content. Content should be natural and unique.
Congratulations, you know the fundamentals to start auditing websites for their SEO! Your site will have a boost in domain authority soon!
