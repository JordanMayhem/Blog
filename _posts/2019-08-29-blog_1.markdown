Welcome to my blog!

This first week I set up a blog and did the first lab. Jekyll was a simple platform to install, but using git requests is still new. Using the blog should be easier from here on out.

For the lab, I had problems accessing Steve's container and doing a scp command. Otherwise, docker seems incredibly powerful and is a good change to how CIT 160 used to be taught.

Overall I'm excited to be in senior design and I'm already learning!
